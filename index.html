											<p>
												The junior design competition is open to students having completed less than 60 credits. 
												Just like the senior design competition, participants, in teams of four are asked to solve a problem in a limited amount of time using basic engineering skills. 
												The day of the event, teams will be provided with the specific material that is to be used for their design. 
												The team evaluation will be based on the quality of their prototype as well as the quality of their presentation.
